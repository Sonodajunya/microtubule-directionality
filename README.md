# MTdirectionality

Uses PlusTipTracker output to determine microtubule growth orientation relative to a user-specified axis of the cell. The script will plot a map of tracks overlaid onto an image of the cell colour-coded for their directionality. It will also generate a histogram with the relative frequency of angles and determine the Kuiper statistics relative to a random distribution. 

This Matlab function that has been tested to run on MATLAB_R2012b. Please see description in the MATLAB function itself and the original publications for more detail: Theisen et al. (2012) Developmental Cell 23:1153-1166 and Mogessie et al. (2015) eLife.
